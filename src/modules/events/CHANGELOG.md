# events — changelog

This desktop module's own versions, newest first (docs/MODULES.md). MAJOR: another module, the server contract or
a saved offline shape has to change with it. MINOR: something new. PATCH: a fix. The app's release notes stay in
the root CHANGELOG.md.

## 1.0.4 — 2026-10-26

**Changed**

- the figure cards (KPI, stat and summary tiles) are the shared StatCard — compact, a tinted icon chip and the label above a calm figure, a muted line under it, zero shown muted; cards that open a list are buttons with a focus ring and a soft lift; the same figures and actions as before

## 1.0.3 — 2026-10-03

- Sync buttons use the shared Sync button: they spin from the click, can't be pressed twice, show Synced just now or Sync failed · Retry, and keep one width (#165).

## 1.0.2 — 2026-10-01

**Changed**

- checkboxes use the shared WorkSuite checkbox — one size, the brand colour with a clear tick, a partly-chosen state on Select all, and ticking a row no longer opens it (#58)

## 1.0.1 — 2026-10-01

**Fixed**

- the build on macOS and Windows, where a screen and its helper file had names that differed only in case (the screen is now DeskScreen.tsx)

## 1.0.0 — 2026-09-30

- The baseline: the module as it stood when each module began to carry its own version. Its history before this is in the app's CHANGELOG.md.
